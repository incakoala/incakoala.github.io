## About

I am a Master of Development Engineering student at UC Berkeley. I have backgrounds in both sociology and computer science, and have 3+ years of experience as a Software Engineer in edtech. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of data science, sociology, and urban planning. Specifically I'm interested in using data to gain deeper insights into how cultures, societies, public policies, and post-colonialism and post-war inform and shape urban issues faced by marginalized communities in my native Vietnam and locally in the Bay Area where I've called home the past five years.
